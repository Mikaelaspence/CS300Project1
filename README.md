# CS300Project1

In working on this project, I did not come into many problems. Writing pseudocode is much easier for me than writing the actual code, since it is not language specific. I have taken a few programming courses thus far in my program, and this is the first class where I have seen the same language twice (C++). In this project, I was able to write pseudocode for three different data structures and chose the one that seemed the most efficient for the task based on runtimes. Although I did not come into any particular problems, this code helped me to set up and prepare for our final project, and had me thinking through the previous material in the course again. Choosing the correct data structure for a task is important, as the runtimes can get exponentially higher when there is a lot of data to process. Getting a better understnading of the implication of choosing a certain data structure over another will go a long way in helping me through the upcoming course work as I progress through the program.
